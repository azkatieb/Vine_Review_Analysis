# Vine_Review_Analysis

## Overview
In this project, we are analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. In this analysis, we specifically analyzed the reviews of beauty products dataset on Amazon.

## Summary

Based on the analysis of the Beauty products data set, there were a total of 647 reviews from the Amazon Vine Program. Of the total 5 star reviews in the category, there were only 606 5 star reviews. Of the 5 star reviews, only 1 of them came from one of the Amazon Vine Program members. 1 paid Vine review equals only a 0.165% of all of the 606 Five Star reviews. This shows that there is no positivity bias in the beauty dataset from the Amazon Vine program. An additional analysis that could be conducted on this dataset would be to find what the average star rating is on the paid vine reviews of the dataset. This would tell us that for the reviews that were paid, what those reviewers rated the products to help support our positivity bias statement.
